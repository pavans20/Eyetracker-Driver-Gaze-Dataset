# Driver Gaze Data Collection and Annotation 
The driver gaze data collection experiment was conducted in the Transportation Engineering Lab of the Department of Civil Engineering at IIT Kanpur. A benchmark driver gaze dataset was created using eyetracker, the details of which are given below. Also the link of sample face came video and rear cam video which are available on YouTube is given here.//

## ET-DGaze: Eyetracker based Driver Gaze Dataset. 
The ET-DGaze dataset is one of the first driver gaze datasets where gaze annotations were derived from eye tracker outputs. The data was collected inside a stationary vehicle under varying lighting conditions on the driver’s face. The dataset comprises 12,000 labeled images from 40 participants (36-Male, 4-Female), with the driver’s gaze classified into nine distinct zones, covering areas such as the windshield and dashboard—typical regions drivers look at during driving.

The dataset is organized into nine folders labeled 1 to 9, each corresponding to a specific gaze zone:

Left side window
Left wing mirror
Left windshield
Rear-view mirror
Center stack
Forward/front windshield
Speedometer
Right side window
Right wing mirror
The ET-DGaze dataset is available for researchers for non-profit, non-commercial research purposes. Interested researchers can request access by emailing us at pavans20@iitk.ac.in.

Some sample image of this dataset is given below.
