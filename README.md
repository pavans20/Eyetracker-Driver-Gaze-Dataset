# Eyetracker-Driver-Gaze-Dataset
ET-DGaze

## ET-DGaze: ET-DGaze stand for Eyetracker Driver Gaze Dataset. 
The ET-DGaze dataset is one of the pioneering driver gaze datasets where gaze annotations were derived from eye tracker outputs. The data was collected inside a stationary vehicle under varying lighting conditions on the driver’s face. The dataset comprises 12,000 labeled images from 40 participants, with the driver’s gaze classified into nine distinct zones, covering areas such as the windshield and dashboard—typical regions drivers look at during driving.

The dataset is organized into nine folders labeled 1 to 9, each corresponding to a specific gaze zone:

Left side window
Left wing mirror
Left windshield
Rear-view mirror
Center stack
Forward/front windshield
Speedometer
Right side window
Right wing mirror
The ET-DGaze dataset is available for researchers for non-profit, non-commercial research purposes. Interested researchers can request access by emailing us at pavans20@iitk.ac.in.
