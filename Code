We have primary used python language for preprocessing and analysis data for plotting different graphs such as bar chart, confusion matrix etc.
For Manual Annotation Misclassification analysis following code was used for face detection, head pose estimation, and pupil detection.
Face Detect:
We have created our own face detector using YOLOV4.

In our study face detector was used to obtain the face bounding box coordinate which was further used for head pose Estimation.
Head pose Estimation:
In this study head pose was measured in terms of Euler Angle (Yaw, Pitch, Roll) using Hopenet Algorithm. Details of Hopenet is given in following Link.

Pupil Detection:
Pupil was detected using pupil lab pupil detector, python package. Python code of pupil detection originally present in the following link.
